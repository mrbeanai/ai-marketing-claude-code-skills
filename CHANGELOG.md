# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI Marketing Skills for Claude Code library.

---

## [2.0.0] — February 2026

### What Changed

Major upgrade across 12 skills. Every updated skill was graded against the [Claude Code Skill Effectiveness Rubric](https://brianrwagner.com) and rebuilt to score 85+/100.

### Added to all upgraded skills

- **Context Loading Gates** — explicit checklist before any output; skill refuses to proceed without required inputs (URL, positioning statement, writing samples, etc.)
- **Structured Reasoning Phases** — multi-step analysis before generating (Phase 1: intake → Phase 2: analysis → Phase 3: generate → Phase 4: critique → Phase 5: deliver)
- **Self-Critique Pass** — mandatory structured review checklist applied to output before delivery
- **Iteration Protocol** — defined process for refining weak output
- **Output Structure** — exact named markdown sections and formatting conventions per skill
